Breadth-first search has many applications. In this Assignment, we use it to efficiently find a solution for the puzzle known as instant insanity. The puzzle has four cubes with faces painted with four colours. Each cube is unique. The goal for solving the puzzle is stacking the four cubes one on the top of another to create a tower where each face of the tower has no duplicated colour, equivalently, each face of the tower has all the four colours. We have to techniques to solving the puzzle. Generate and Test is the first approuch; this method goes through 24^4 orientations and tests each orientation. Second approuch is BreadthFirstSearch which is a more systematic approuch.
